# Similarity-Based-CS
This project addresses the curse of dimensionality in feature selection methods, with a focus on supervised and semi-supervised learning. It introduces a novel constraint score that evaluates the relevance of feature subsets in a lower-dimensional subspace, taking into account correlations between features and avoiding high-dimensional original feature spaces.

## Key Components :

- Curse of Dimensionality: The project tackles the challenges associated with high-dimensional data and the impact on machine learning tasks.

- Feature Selection: Describes the process of selecting a subset of relevant features to improve model efficiency and effectiveness.

- Constraint Scores: Explains the use of must-link and cannot-link constraints and their limitations when evaluating individual features.

- Correlations Between Features: Highlights the importance of considering feature interactions and dependencies in real-world data.

- High-Dimensional Original Feature Space: Discusses the issues associated with working in high-dimensional spaces and its impact on similarity computation.

- New Constraint Score: Introduces the primary focus of the project, which is the development of a novel constraint score that operates on feature subsets in a lower-dimensional subspace.
