# Similarity-Based-CS
This project addresses the curse of dimensionality in feature selection methods, with a focus on supervised and semi-supervised learning. It introduces a novel constraint score that evaluates the relevance of feature subsets in a lower-dimensional subspace, taking into account correlations between features and avoiding high-dimensional original feature spaces.
